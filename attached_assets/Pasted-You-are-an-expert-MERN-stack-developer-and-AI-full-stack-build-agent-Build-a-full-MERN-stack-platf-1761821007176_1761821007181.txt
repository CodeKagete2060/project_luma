Follow these steps — do NOT code all at once.

Create MERN folder structure

Install dependencies

Build backend auth + roles

Build protected routes + JWT

Build MongoDB models

Create dashboards UI

Add AI homework assistant with fallback responses

At each step say:

Step complete. Shall I continue?

Never skip steps.
Never assume.
Ask if unsure.

When creating files use tree structure preview first, then generate code.

Agent Rules

Output code in modular structure

Explain what you created each step

Ask before moving to next phase

Do not generate huge files at once — split into logical pieces
